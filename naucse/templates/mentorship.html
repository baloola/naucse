            <p>
                With finishing a Beginners Python Course your coding journey does not stop! On the contrary actually. Now you are familiar with building blocks and it is on you to decide in which directions to go. There is no limit. And mentors and our mentorship programme can help you.
                This programme is aiming on connecting mentees with mentors based on needs and wishes of the mentee and expertise of the mentors. It would be great if you are able to define what you are looking for, but if you just want a learning buddy it is also fine.

                    The programme is not formalized at this point - you can agree on video calls, personal meetings or email communication as you prefer and same goes for the frequency. Please keep in mind that all of us are doing this in our free time and mentoring doesn't mean that a mentor is available all the time.
                    
                    The planned duration of the mentorship will be defined by the mentor and mentee upon shared expectation and understanding. However, we expect the average duration of the programme to be around 6 months.
