        <p class="mb-0">I'm incredibly grateful for the experience I could make during the "Beginners Course". The mentors were outstanding, offering beginner-friendly explanations and lots of room for our many questions.Beyond coding, learning tools like GitHub and CLI was really great. The personalized feedback on homework assignments was particularly helpful. I am thankful to PyLadies for this enriching experience and highly recommend their course to anyone starting their coding journey.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Being part of the Spring 2023 Pyladies course was a pleasure for me as it allowed me to get a basic understanding of how to work with Python. It is already helpful for me in my job as a Product Manager as sometimes I need to go into GitHub and understand what my devs have done (I indeed understood a custom function a few weeks after the course). Having such great mentors sharing their know-how and experience with us was great and very motivating for continuing investing into learning Python.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Amazing course with great mentors. The lessons are clear, well organized and interesting. The mentors are always willing to help and answer any question. I have never believed I would learn so much in a short free course but I did and after finishing it I can code!</p>

        <p class="mb-0">To all the Ladies interested in coding - take this chance to learn, to cooperate, to get and give support, to cry and to succeed! A great way to meet other interested and ambitious women and to learn how to write Python code.</p>
